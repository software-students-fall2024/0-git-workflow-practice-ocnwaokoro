### The [instructions](./instructions.md) demand:

1. A link to an article or web site I find interesting that is related to software engineering
* [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit)

2. A paragraph or two about what I found interesting about that article
* This article was somewhat interesting to me because it relates to the git workflow practice that we are doing for this assignment. I have used git before and my commit messages have often been created without thought. However, this particular article convinced me that git commits and other logs are particularly important to pay attention to because they directly impact the maintainability of the code.
* In order to address the problem of people making pretty bad git commit messages, the article presents 7 key rules for making a great commit message. These are to (1) separate the subject from the body with a blank line, (2) limit the subject line to 50 characters, (3) capitalize the subject line, (4) refrain from ending the subject line with a period, (5) use the imperative mood in the subject line, (6) wrap the body at 72 characters, and (7) use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

3. Cool Markdown syntax to make it look nice
* Hopefully, this has been done?
